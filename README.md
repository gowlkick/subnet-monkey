# subnet-monkey
Playground for learning ways to use Python to do simple networking stuff

Initial project for myself:

Write a subnet calculator in Python. Produce often-needed information such as usable IPs (number and range), dotted quad netmask, and network and broadcast addresses.

I'll start with IPv4, but once I get that done, I'll see how much of this can be repurposed for IPv6.
